Busting 31 boxes â€“ a proper calendar which lets you focus your plans.

Inspired by [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2010/03/28/more-ideas-than-time-logarithmic-calendar-view), [Continuous Calendar](http://madebyevan.com/calendar), [Four Times Daily](http://fourtimesdaily.com)
Future inspiration: [SlideScreen](http://slidescreenhome.com), [Flipboard](http://flipboard.com), [DeepaMehta](http://deepamehta.de/en)



## Design

* **time is linear**, unlike month & week views in normal calendars, time just flows in one direction
* **interface is inherent**, no interface controls when the problem can be solved more elegantly
* **everything is an event**, tasks should not be separated from events


## Roadmap

* januaray sometimes has the wrong year
* make month header sticky
* add a notifier pointing in the direction where today is.
* make events draggable.
* only show first part of event description (title). expand on hover/click.
* dynamic day size.
* on mobile: hide menu when keyboard open
* multiple calendars ?
* add remotestorage.
* update calendar at least once a day. select today & adjust sizes of days.
* compatible with other calendars.
* add web notifications.
For more check #2.


## Unhosted (planned)

**This app allows you to use your own data storage!** Its code is fully client-side without any server backend you need to trust! Find out more about the [Unhosted movement](http://unhosted.org). localStorage is used as fallback, so you can also use it offline.



## Contribute

* checkout the .editorconfig file
* Open index.html with your webserver of choice
